# Basic Multiplayer

This is my initial attempt at creating a multiplayer game. Use the spacebar to jump (you have unlimited jumps) and use the left/right arrow keys or the "A" and "D" keys to move left and right. Multiple people can play at the same time and have their movements synced on the screen. <br>Maximum of four players allowed (If four players are playing, you will be unable to join/play the game. You will see the "level" but will not see the black square character appear)<br><br>
