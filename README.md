# Basic Multiplayer

This is my initial attempt at creating a multiplayer game. Use the spacebar to jump (you have unlimited jumps) and use the left/right arrow keys or the "A" and "D" keys to move left and right. Multiple people can play at the same time and have their movements synced on the screen. Maximum of four players allowed.
